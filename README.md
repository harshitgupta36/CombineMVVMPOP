# Combine+MVVM+POP+Solid+Safe(Coading+Decoding)

## Overview

`Combine_POP_MVVM` is a Swift project demonstrating the integration of the Combine framework with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern and Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP). The project includes functionality for fetching and adding employee data, utilizing Combine for asynchronous operations, and implementing a router for managing network requests.

## Key Concepts

### Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

MVVM separates the application into:

- **Model:** Represents data and business logic.
- **View:** UI components that display data.
- **ViewModel:** Manages data transformation and state. In this project, it is represented by `EmployeeViewModel`.

### Combine Framework

Combine handles asynchronous operations by:

- Using **`AnyPublisher`** and **`sink`** to manage network responses.
- Employing **`@Published`** to update the state for the View.

### Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP)

POP emphasizes:

- **Protocols** like `NetworkProvider` and `EmployeeNetworkProvider` to define behavior.
- **Protocol Extensions** to provide default implementations and extend functionality.
